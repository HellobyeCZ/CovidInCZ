# CovidInCZ (CURRENTLY NOT WORKING)
- Not working due the urls/apis stopped distributting data from our government sites.

Repo for my quick dashboards for Covid cases predictions in Czech Republic.

This is the result of my covid lockdown boredom.
My prediction became too accurate, so I kinda stopped doing them, because I saw that government was doin nothing to stop them.
You can see all my prediction as .html in separate folder.
